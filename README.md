# Command-Line-Password-Manager
This is a secure, Python-based command-line password manager. It protects your saved passwords using AES encryption (with the cryptography library) and stores them safely in a local vault.json file.

Access is protected by a master password, and all inputs are hidden using getpass. You can add, view, and manage login details for websites or appsâ€”only after entering the correct master key.
